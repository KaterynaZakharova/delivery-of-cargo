# Delivery of Cargo

Site for a delivery company.

  There are three roles: 
* User;
* Authorized User;
* Manager.

The website of the cargo delivery company contains information about the directions of delivery, as well as about tariffs (tariffs depend on the distance, weight and dimensions of the cargo).
An unregistered user can view information on the site, sorting or filtering it by delivery direction, and also has the ability to calculate the cost of services.

An authorized user can create a request for delivery of goods and specify the delivery address. The application contains information about the type of luggage, weight, volume and date of receipt.

The manager processes applications and generates receipts for payment, and can also receive reports on deliveries (by days and destinations).

An authorized user in his office can pay for the delivery receipt.
